I’ve had the good fortune to have some amazing mentors in my career, and one of the best has been [John Allspaw](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jallspaw/). I remember meeting with John at Etsy headquarters in 2014 or so, and him explaining the concept of “DevOps” to me like this (warning: gross oversimplification of what John actually said):

“It’s a bit of a cliché but like most clichés there’s an element of truth: developers want to go fast, system operators want stability, customers want both. So we need a culture, supported by better practices and technology, that allows us and our customers to have our cake and eat it.”

DevOps. Dev and Ops. Individually great, better together … but only if they understand and respect the other’s craft, and only if they have a high-trust and high-respect relationship. Got it and makes sense.

But when I went to IBM Design, I came to realize that dev and ops are only two small but important parts of a much larger equation. If you zoom out, you can think of dev and ops as sub-disciplines of the larger discipline of engineering. And now my job in IBM Design was to help bring design and engineering closer together … understanding, respect, and trust across disciplines.

But as [Charlie Hill](https://www.linkedin.com/in/charliehill/) and I worked through this massive alignment process, we realized that you could go more or less infinitely big, to all disciplines involved in the creation, evolution, and delivery of products to customers and partners. Net just dev and ops, not just design and engineering, but also product management, marketing, sales, consulting, support, and and and and …

We called this “the whole-team approach” and Charlie used a visual metaphor of a whitewater rafting team to make the point … you’re navigating a treacherous environment, and you succeed or fail as a team. This metaphor really resonated with people.

But how to get disciplines to work better together? One of our problems at the time was that different disciplines used different tools, which was like the digital equivalent of working in different buildings. So we formed a hypothesis that better collaboration tools could create the conditions for better interdisciplinary collaboration. That’s the next story: Project Whitewater https://lnkd.in/eSKiYJKz
