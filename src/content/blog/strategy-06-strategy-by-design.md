So the Tivoli SaaS app was a big success, I had presented it to 5,000 humans at the MGM Grand in Vegas (!) but I was a bit burnt out. So when [Robert LeBlanc](https://www.linkedin.com/in/robert-leblanc-0b4b0485/) sent me and the team down to Austin, Texas for IBM Designcamp for Product teams it was fine by me because 1) it seemed like a nice little work vacation, and 2) Austin has way better Mexican food than my home of Raleigh, NC. So, wheels up to Austin. ✈️

I expected to sit through some lectures during the day and eat Mexican food and drink beer during the night, but I got much, much more. I’ve [told the story elsewhere](https://lnkd.in/eJhztyhv), so I won’t re-tell it here, but [Adam Cutler’s](https://www.linkedin.com/in/adamcutler/) motivational speech on “Why design thinking matters?” changed the course of my life and career. I hit up IBM Design leader [Phil Gilbert](https://www.linkedin.com/in/philgilbertsr/) for a job, and soon I found myself as “the design-curious engineer in the IBM Design core team.” It was really, really amazing.

I was surrounded by literally world-class designers and they so generously shared their expertise with me: [Alice Clark](https://www.linkedin.com/in/alicemclark/) taught me about user research, [Doug Powell](https://www.linkedin.com/in/douglaspowell330/) taught me about crafting iconic experiences, [Charlie Hill](https://www.linkedin.com/in/charliehill/) taught me about experiment-driven design, and Phil Gilbert taught me about transformation.

Now, please understand this point: Learning from Phil Gilbert about transformation is like learning from Yoda about The Force. So for two years, I sat at the foot of the master and watched how he incrementally transformed IBM to learn better design culture, and employ better design practices. Among the many things he taught me, he taught me a few more elements of strategy:

- The importance of framing everything in terms of desired outcomes
- How to incrementally build out scalable programs
- The important distinction between mission and outcomes

On this last point, like most big things, the mission of IBM Design was simple to state, very hard to do: Creating, in IBM, a sustainable culture of design. And in order to achieve that mission, we had to deliver incremental and iterative outcomes that were good for IBM customers and good for IBM revenue and cash flow.

I also came to understand that my concept of DevOps (dev and ops working harmoniously together) had to become much broader. So Charlie and I developed what we called “the whole-team approach” which is the topic for our next episode … https://lnkd.in/eURVp6_z
