There was no ChatGPT in 2010, so I started with a literal Google search:

“Best strategy books”

I started with a few classic memoirs I’d read before, but took on new meaning given my work/life situation:

- Jack Welch’s [Jack: Straight From the Gut](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/5559.Jack) (2001)
- Lou Gerstner’s [Who Says Elephants Can’t Dance?](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/603985.Who_Says_Elephants_Can_t_Dance_Inside_IBM_s_Historic_Turnaround) (2002)

Both of these books were helpful because they discussed applied (vs. theoretical) strategy in the context of historic transformations of iconic companies (Welch with GE circa-1980 to 2000, Gerstner with IBM circa-1993 to 2001). At the same time, though no books were written yet, I could read articles and listen to podcasts about how Steve Jobs and Tim Cook were methodically transforming Apple into the most valuable company in the world, with their miraculous decade and a half of innovation: iMac, iPod, iTunes, Apple Stores, iPhone, iPad.

Then, a few years into my study, a couple of excellent theoretical books were published:

- Richard Rumelt’s [Good Strategy, Bad Strategy](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/11721966-good-strategy-bad-strategy) (2011)
- Lawrence Freedman’s epic [Strategy: A History](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17847473-strategy) (2013)

These books helped me put the applied strategy stories of Welch / Gerstner / Jobs into a theoretical framework, which I believe is a requirement to then produce something new, i.e., my own strategies.

But it was not all theoretical; by 2012 I started putting in place some initial applied elements, inspired (in this case) by Steve Jobs (though he did not use this term): The A-Team.

More on that in my next post: “The A-Team (alpha)” https://lnkd.in/eQQQAM6V
