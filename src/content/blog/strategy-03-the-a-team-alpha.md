Let me start with a quote from Steve Jobs:

>For most things in life, the range between best and average is 30% or so. The best airplane flight, the best meal, they may be 30% better than your average one. What I saw with Woz was somebody who was fifty times better than the average engineer. He could have meetings in his head. The Mac team was an attempt to build a whole team like that, A players. People said they wouldn’t get along, they’d hate working with each other. But I realized that A players like to work with A players, they just didn’t like working with C players. At Pixar, it was a whole company of A players. When I got back to Apple, that’s what I decided to try to do. You need to have a collaborative hiring process. When we hire someone, even if they’re going to be in marketing, I will have them talk to the design folks and the engineers. My role model was J. Robert Oppenheimer. I read about the type of people he sought for the atom bomb project. I wasn’t nearly as good as he was, but that’s what I aspired to do.

I know that the concept of the 10x programmer is problematic, but I personally believe that there are certain individuals whose individual productivity and contribution to group productivity is literally off the charts.

As I mentioned before, while I was disappointed that Rational Team Concert did not become the world’s de facto standard software development platform, it was a very successful product, in terms of revenue. And it should not be surprising because the team was amazing. Click some of these LinkedIn profiles to get a sense: [Erich Gamma](https://www.linkedin.com/in/erichgamma/), [Jean-Michel Lemieux](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jmlemieux-613/), [Bill Higgins](https://www.linkedin.com/in/billhiggins1/) (sorry, had to do it).

So, after my initial study of strategy, I decided to start building my own A-Team.

I started keeping my eyes open for “special developers” where “special” was an intuitive judgment vs. any sort of analytical assessment. Sometimes we worked together, as was the case with [Matt Lavin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mdlavin/), who was a Rational colleague. But more often than not, I just stumbled across amazing people, all in their 20s at the time:

- [Jeff Jagoda](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jeff-jagoda-3b52567/) was the technical assistant on our Extreme Blue intern program and brilliant in theory and practice.
- [Christopher Maul](https://www.linkedin.com/in/maulc/) had built his own private cloud to automatically recreate complex customer environments for support purposes.
- [Jeff Sloyer](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jeffsloyer/) had already forgotten more about DevOps and cloud computing than I would ever know.

So I worked with my IBM management to bring them to my team and, if memory serves, we were working on DevOps-y stuff for early 2010s IBM private cloud infrastructure, until one day in June 2013 I got a phone call that would change the course of my career.

But that’s a story for the next post: “[Quality duct tape](../strategy-04-quality-duct-tape/)” …
