In the previous post, I described my realization that to possibly build something great required amazing collaboration across all disciplines: product management, design, engineering, sales, marketing, support, etc. etc. etc.

But circa 2015 at IBM, we were all using different tools.

A couple of years earlier I’d read Ed Catmull’s amazing book “Creativity Inc.” on the creative culture and creative process at Pixar. One of the many things that stuck with me was that they designed the Pixar headquarters with all central functions (cafeteria, restrooms, etc.) in a central atrium to result in Pixar people from different disciplines bumping into each other, starting conversations, perhaps finding synergies, and perhaps from these synergies doing something amazing and iconic.

It occurred to me that the digital tools we use every day could also foster such interdisciplinary serendipity, but not the ones we were using back then. Starting in the IBM Design team but eventually maturing to the IBM CIO group, we started a project (inspired by the whole-team approach; see previous post) called Whitewater, to bring a new generation of collaboration tools to IBM to foster serendipitous interdisciplinary collaboration.

I can distinctly remember the kick-off meeting with [Charlie Hill](https://www.linkedin.com/in/charliehill/), [Konrad Lagarde](https://www.linkedin.com/in/konrad-lagarde-40aaa41/), [Lisa Dyer](https://www.linkedin.com/in/lisadyer/), and [Trevor Bodz](https://www.linkedin.com/in/trevorbodz/) where I said “we need single scalable instances of Slack and GitHub for all of IBM where people from around the world, across business units, and across disciplines can serendipitously bump into each other, like in the Pixar building.”

Little did I know it would consume the next three years of my work-life because it turns out … wait for it … [transformation is hard](../strategy-09-it-turns-out-transformation-is-hard/) …
