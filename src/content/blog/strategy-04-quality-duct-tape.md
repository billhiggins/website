In our last episode, we discussed what for me was the first element of applied good strategy: building an A-Team. So by 2013 I had a great but small A-Team and we working on DevOps-y stuff in IBM’s Tivoli division. And then I got an important phone call.

In my multiple decades of work experience, I’ve been on literally thousands of calls, and I forget 99.99% of them, but some I remember as if they happened yesterday. On June 24, 2013, I had such a call from Dave Lindquist. I remember the date because my wife Chunhui and I were sitting in the hospital, somewhat bored to be honest, several hours away from our third child Elizabeth to be born. And then my phone rang. It was Dave Lindquist, then CTO of the Tivoli division of IBM.

I told my wife “It’s Dave Lindquist” and she said “Answer it!” So I answered and after some small talk, Dave said that Tivoli were about to shift into SaaS and they wanted me to be the technical leader of the SaaS portal. It was kind of incredible, because if you recall, my last project in Rational was a failed attempt to try to shift into SaaS, and now I was getting the opportunity to play a lead role in such a shift to SaaS, but with the full support of senior management. I recall telling Dave “that sounds amazing, I’m in” and then I explained where I was and that I’d be on paternity leave for a few weeks. Dave said “Why the heck are you talking to me?! Go go go and have that baby!” and we hung up.

One month, and one amazing baby later, Dave and I had established the scope of the project, and staffed it with the A-Team I mentioned in the last post, and we started … thinking different, to borrow a phrase.

The first thing was that Dave, and the management above Dave (Chris O’Connor and Deepak Advani), explicitly wanted our team to change the culture of the Tivoli division from on prem and waterfall to agile and devops. So we had the best possible air cover to take calculated risks. So the first thing we decided was that we would build the application on the then-new IBM BlueMix PaaS environment (these days part of IBM Cloud). One problem: It was in an alpha state and because of that, it was pretty unstable, which [led to a lot of stress](../strategy-05-innovation-under-fire/) …
