When we started the Whitewater project in 2015, we explicitly asked IBM CIO senior leadership NOT to mandate the tools like GitHub and Slack, because we wanted their adoption to be organic, such that when people didn’t adopt, we’d get good feedback on how to make the adoption or migration experience easier and more delightful. We got to about 10,000 users for GitHub/Slack and then something interesting happened … [Arvind Krishna](https://www.linkedin.com/in/arvindkrishna/) took notice.

Back then Arvind wasn’t CEO yet but was rather SVP of Hybrid Cloud and Director of Research and one of his many jobs was fundamentally upleveling IBM development. He liked what we were doing with Whitewater and decided that we’d demonstrated enough value that everyone should use the tools. With the benefit of hindsight, we should have immediately gone into a war room situation, but back then I was slightly more naive, so we didn’t notice the rapid acceleration of new users, the rapid increase in GitHub storage use, etc. Then around Spring 2017, everything everywhere all at once … broke.

Mornings were hellish. As the U.S. logged on to Slack and GitHub, nothing was cached so the origin servers got pegged and either slowed or just broke down. Angry VPs would Slack me that GitHub wasn’t working and when Slack stopped working they’d text me. It was the only time in my career that I literally had trouble sleeping at night because what were we going to do, tell people to stop using the tools we had worked so hard to promote?

After many 12-16 hour days and amazing partnerships with leaders like [Jason Warner](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jcw148/) (then) of GitHub and [Michael Lopp](https://www.linkedin.com/in/michaellopp/) (then) of Slack, we got the systems back to stability and, more importantly, sustainability.

And those were just the technical problems. There were a whole other slew of political fights (using 3rd party tools vs. homegrown alternatives) and finally some people just resisted the new practices (Slack channels, GitHub pull requests, etc.). Ultimately we got through it all, though I think I aged 10 years in those 3 years but I learned a hard lesson about recognizing strategic inflection points. By 2017 I was ready to move on from being “the tools guy” to something new, but I had one more act in this part of the story, inciting the great O’Reilly Safari “peasant revolt” of 2017. That’s the next post. https://lnkd.in/ekgnqY9A
