From 2005 to 2010 I worked in IBM’s Rational division on a collaborative software development product called “Rational Team Concert.” Many of you reading this will say “I never heard of it!” and … well … yeah. Don’t get me wrong—it made a lot of money! I remember when I was putting together my IBM Distinguished Engineer (DE) package in the mid-2010s, I researched how much money it made and I was like: 1) wow, that’s a lot of money, and 2) hey, how come I didn’t see more of that?! But I digress.

When we started Rational Team Concert, we thought it was going to take over the world. Basically we thought it was going to become what GitHub ultimately became … the world’s de facto standard team development platform. What happened? I think a few things:

1. IBM senior management at the time prioritized revenue, not adoption, for our development tools; this ultimately shifted the product focus from “tools developers love” to “govern the software development lifecycle.”
2. The team was “building for themselves” and we were a bunch of Eclipse/desktop people as the world was shifting to web/SaaS.

For me this culminated in proposing a web/SaaS version of the product around 2009 and getting it briefly staffed and funded, but then management killed it six months later when the money-making 3.0 version of the on-prem products got behind schedule and needed all hands on deck.

This put me in a state of “work depression” for about six months as I went through the motions supporting the 3.0 release and then ultimately found a different job in IBM to escape Rational.

But, as Conan the Barbarian once said, “That which does not kill us makes us stronger,” so during this time of mini-work depression, I reached some important personal conclusions:

- I can’t code my way out of a bad strategy.
- I can’t blindly trust others to be in charge of strategy; I better own it or at least have significant input into it.

So I decided to immerse myself in studying strategy, which ended up occupying most of the 2010s.
